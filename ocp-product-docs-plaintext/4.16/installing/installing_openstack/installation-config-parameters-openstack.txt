# Installation configuration parameters for OpenStack


Before you deploy an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster on Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP), you provide parameters to customize your cluster and the platform that hosts it. When you create the install-config.yaml file, you provide values for the required parameters through the command line. You can then modify the install-config.yaml file to customize your cluster further.

# Available installation configuration parameters for OpenStack

The following tables specify the required, optional, and OpenStack-specific installation configuration parameters that you can set as part of the installation process.


[NOTE]
----
After installation, you cannot modify these parameters in the install-config.yaml file.

## Required configuration parameters

Required installation configuration parameters are described in the following table:



## Network configuration parameters

You can customize your installation configuration based on the requirements of your existing network infrastructure. For example, you can expand the IP address block for the cluster network or provide different IP address blocks than the defaults.

Only IPv4 addresses are supported.


[NOTE]
----
Globalnet is not supported with Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation disaster recovery solutions. For regional disaster recovery scenarios, ensure that you use a nonoverlapping range of private IP addresses for the cluster and service networks in each cluster.

## Optional configuration parameters

Optional installation configuration parameters are described in the following table:



## Additional Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP) configuration parameters

Additional RHOSP configuration parameters are described in the following table:



1. If the machine pool defines zones, the count of types can either be a single item or match the number of items in zones. For example, the count of types cannot be 2 if there are 3 items in zones.
2. If you have any existing reference to this property, the installer populates the corresponding value in the controlPlane.platform.openstack.rootVolume.types field.

## Optional RHOSP configuration parameters

Optional RHOSP configuration parameters are described in the following table:
