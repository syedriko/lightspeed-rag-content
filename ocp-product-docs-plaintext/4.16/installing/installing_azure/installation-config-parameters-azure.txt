# Installation configuration parameters for Azure


Before you deploy an Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster on Microsoft Azure, you provide parameters to customize your cluster and the platform that hosts it. When you create the install-config.yaml file, you provide values for the required parameters through the command line. You can then modify the install-config.yaml file to customize your cluster further.

# Available installation configuration parameters for Azure

The following tables specify the required, optional, and Azure-specific installation configuration parameters that you can set as part of the installation process.


[NOTE]
----
After installation, you cannot modify these parameters in the install-config.yaml file.
----

## Required configuration parameters

Required installation configuration parameters are described in the following table:



## Network configuration parameters

You can customize your installation configuration based on the requirements of your existing network infrastructure. For example, you can expand the IP address block for the cluster network or provide different IP address blocks than the defaults.

Only IPv4 addresses are supported.


[NOTE]
----
Globalnet is not supported with Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation disaster recovery solutions. For regional disaster recovery scenarios, ensure that you use a nonoverlapping range of private IP addresses for the cluster and service networks in each cluster.
----



## Optional configuration parameters

Optional installation configuration parameters are described in the following table:



+


[IMPORTANT]
----
Setting this parameter to Manual enables alternatives to storing administrator-level secrets in the kube-system project, which require additional configuration steps. For more information, see "Alternatives to storing administrator-level secrets in the kube-system project".

## Additional Azure configuration parameters

Additional Azure configuration parameters are described in the following table.


[NOTE]
----
By default, if you specify availability zones in the install-config.yaml file, the installation program distributes the control plane machines and the compute machines across these availability zones
within a region. To ensure high availability for your cluster, select a region with at least three availability zones. If your region contains fewer than three availability zones, the installation program places more than one control plane machine in the available zones.
