# Extensions


Extensions add capabilities to the Collector. For example, authentication can be added to the receivers and exporters automatically.

# BearerTokenAuth Extension

The BearerTokenAuth Extension is an authenticator for receivers and exporters that are based on the HTTP and the gRPC protocol.
You can use the OpenTelemetry Collector custom resource to configure client authentication and server authentication for the BearerTokenAuth Extension on the receiver and exporter side.
This extension supports traces, metrics, and logs.

Client identifier, which is provided by the identity provider.
Confidential key used to authenticate the client to the identity provider.
Further metadata, in the key-value pair format, which is transferred during authentication. For example, audience specifies the intended audience for the access token, indicating the recipient of the token.

The scopes define the specific permissions or access levels requested by the client.
The Transport Layer Security (TLS) settings for the token client, which is used to establish a secure connection when requesting tokens.
When set to true, configures the Collector to use an insecure or non-verified TLS connection to call the configured token endpoint.
The path to a Certificate Authority (CA) file that is used to verify the server's certificate during the TLS handshake.
The path to the client certificate file that the client must use to authenticate itself to the OAuth2 server if required.
The path to the client's private key file that is used with the client certificate if needed for authentication.

# File Storage Extension

The File Storage Extension supports traces, metrics, and logs. This extension can persist the state to the local file system. This extension persists the sending queue for the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) exporters that are based on the HTTP and the gRPC protocols.

Starts the File Storage Extension by the Collector.

# OIDC Auth Extension

The OIDC Auth Extension authenticates incoming requests to receivers by using the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol.
