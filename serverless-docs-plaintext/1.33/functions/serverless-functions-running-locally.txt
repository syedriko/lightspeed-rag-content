# Running functions locally


You can run a function locally by using the kn func tool. This can be useful, for example, for testing the function before deploying it to the cluster.

# Running a function locally

You can use the kn func run command to run a function locally in the current directory or in the directory specified by the --path flag. If the function that you are running has never previously been built, or if the project files have been modified since the last time it was built, the kn func run command builds the function before running it by default.


```terminal
$ kn func run
```



```terminal
$ kn func run --path=<directory_path>
```


You can also force a rebuild of an existing image before running the function, even if there have been no changes to the project files, by using the --build flag:


```terminal
$ kn func run --build
```


If you set the build flag as false, this disables building of the image, and runs the function using the previously built image:


```terminal
$ kn func run --build=false
```


You can use the help command to learn more about kn func run command options:


```terminal
$ kn func help run
```
