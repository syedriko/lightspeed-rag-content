You can deploy your functions to the cluster by using the kn func tool.

# Deploying a function

You can deploy a function to your cluster as a Knative service by using the kn func deploy command. If the targeted function is already deployed, it is updated with a new container image that is pushed to a container image registry, and the Knative service is updated.

* The OpenShift Serverless Operator and Knative Serving are installed on the cluster.
* You have installed the Knative (kn) CLI.
* You have created a project or have access to a project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in OpenShift Container Platform.
* You must have already created and initialized the function that you want to deploy.

* Deploy a function:

```terminal
$ kn func deploy [-n <namespace> -p <path> -i <image>]
```

Example output

```terminal
Function deployed at: http://func.example.com
```

* If no namespace is specified, the function is deployed in the current namespace.
* The function is deployed from the current directory, unless a path is specified.
* The Knative service name is derived from the project name, and cannot be changed using this command.


[NOTE]
----
You can create a serverless function with a Git repository URL by using Import from Git or Create Serverless Function in the +Add view of the Developer perspective.
