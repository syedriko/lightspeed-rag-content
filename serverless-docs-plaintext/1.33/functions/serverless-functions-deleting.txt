# Deleting a function

You can delete a function by using the kn func delete command. This is useful when a function is no longer required, and can help to save resources on your cluster.

* Delete a function:

```terminal
$ kn func delete [<function_name> -n <namespace> -p <path>]
```

* If the name or path of the function to delete is not specified, the current directory is searched for a func.yaml file that is used to determine the function to delete.
* If the namespace is not specified, it defaults to the namespace value in the func.yaml file.
