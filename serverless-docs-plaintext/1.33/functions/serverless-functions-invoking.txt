# Invoking functions


You can test a deployed function by invoking it. You can do it using the kn func tool.

# Invoking a deployed function with a test event

You can use the kn func invoke CLI command to send a test request to invoke a function either locally or on your OpenShift Container Platform cluster. You can use this command to test that a function is working and able to receive events correctly. Invoking a function locally is useful for a quick test during function development. Invoking a function on the cluster is useful for testing that is closer to the production environment.

* The OpenShift Serverless Operator and Knative Serving are installed on the cluster.
* You have installed the Knative (kn) CLI.
* You have created a project or have access to a project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in OpenShift Container Platform.
* You must have already deployed the function that you want to invoke.

* Invoke a function:

```terminal
$ kn func invoke
```

* The kn func invoke command only works when there is either a local container image currently running, or when there is a function deployed in the cluster.
* The kn func invoke command executes on the local directory by default, and assumes that this directory is a function project.
