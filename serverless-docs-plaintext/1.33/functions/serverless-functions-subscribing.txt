# Subscribing functions to CloudEvents


You can subscribe a function to a set of events. This links your function to CloudEvent objects defined by your filters and enables automated responses.

# Subscribing a function to CloudEvents

The subscribe command connects the function to a set of events, matching a series of filters for CloudEvent metadata and a Knative Broker as the source of events, from where they are consumed.

* You have installed Knative Eventing on the cluster.
* You have configured a Knative Broker.
* You have installed the Knative (kn) CLI.

1. Subscribe the function to events for a given broker by running the following command:
Example command

```terminal
$ kn func subscribe --filter type=com.example.Hello --source my-broker
```


Use the --source flag to specify the broker and one or more --filter flags to specify your filters.

You can also omit the --source flag to use the default broker:
Example command

```terminal
$ kn func subscribe --filter type=com.example --filter extension=my-extension-value
```

2. Deploy the function with Knative Triggers:
Example command

```terminal
$ kn func deploy
```

Example output

```terminal
ðŸ™Œ Function image built: <registry>/hello:latest
ðŸŽ¯ Creating Triggers on the cluster
âœ… Function deployed in namespace "default" and exposed at URL:
http://hello.default.my-cluster.example.com
```
