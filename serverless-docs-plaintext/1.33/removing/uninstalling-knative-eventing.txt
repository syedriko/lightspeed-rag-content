# Uninstalling OpenShift Serverless Knative Eventing

Before you can remove the OpenShift Serverless Operator, you must remove Knative Eventing. To uninstall Knative Eventing, you must remove the KnativeEventing custom resource (CR) and delete the knative-eventing namespace.

# Uninstalling Knative Eventing

* You have cluster administrator permissions on OpenShift Container Platform, or you have cluster or dedicated administrator permissions on OpenShift Dedicated.
* Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. Delete the KnativeEventing CR:

```terminal
$ oc delete knativeeventings.operator.knative.dev knative-eventing -n knative-eventing
```

2. After the command has completed and all pods have been removed from the knative-eventing namespace, delete the namespace:

```terminal
$ oc delete namespace knative-eventing
```
