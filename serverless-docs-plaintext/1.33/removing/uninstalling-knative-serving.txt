# Uninstalling OpenShift Serverless Knative Serving

Before you can remove the OpenShift Serverless Operator, you must remove Knative Serving. To uninstall Knative Serving, you must remove the KnativeServing custom resource (CR) and delete the knative-serving namespace.

# Uninstalling Knative Serving

* You have cluster administrator permissions on OpenShift Container Platform, or you have cluster or dedicated administrator permissions on OpenShift Dedicated.
* Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. Delete the KnativeServing CR:

```terminal
$ oc delete knativeservings.operator.knative.dev knative-serving -n knative-serving
```

2. After the command has completed and all pods have been removed from the knative-serving namespace, delete the namespace:

```terminal
$ oc delete namespace knative-serving
```
