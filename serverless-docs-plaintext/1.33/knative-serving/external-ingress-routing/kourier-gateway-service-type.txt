# Kourier Gateway service type

The Kourier Gateway is exposed by default as the ClusterIP service type. This service type is determined by the service-type ingress spec in the KnativeServing custom resource (CR).

```yaml
...
spec:
  ingress:
    kourier:
      service-type: ClusterIP
...
```

# Setting the Kourier Gateway service type

You can override the default service type to use a load balancer service type instead by modifying the service-type spec:


```yaml
...
spec:
  ingress:
    kourier:
      service-type: LoadBalancer
...
```
