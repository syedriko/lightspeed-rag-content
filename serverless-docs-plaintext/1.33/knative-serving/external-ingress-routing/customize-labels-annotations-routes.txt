# Customizing labels and annotations


OpenShift Container Platform routes support the use of custom labels and annotations, which you can configure by modifying the metadata spec of a Knative service. Custom labels and annotations are propagated from the service to the Knative route, then to the Knative ingress, and finally to the OpenShift Container Platform route.

# Customizing labels and annotations for OpenShift Container Platform routes

* You must have the OpenShift Serverless Operator and Knative Serving installed on your OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. Create a Knative service that contains the label or annotation that you want to propagate to the OpenShift Container Platform route:
* To create a service by using YAML:
Example service created by using YAML

```yaml
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: <service_name>
  labels:
    <label_name>: <label_value>
  annotations:
    <annotation_name>: <annotation_value>
...
```

* To create a service by using the Knative (kn) CLI, enter:
Example service created by using a kn command

```terminal
$ kn service create <service_name> \
  --image=<image> \
  --annotation <annotation_name>=<annotation_value> \
  --label <label_value>=<label_value>
```

2. Verify that the OpenShift Container Platform route has been created with the annotation or label that you added by inspecting the output from the following command:
Example command for verification

```terminal
$ oc get routes.route.openshift.io \
     -l serving.knative.openshift.io/ingressName=<service_name> \ 1
     -l serving.knative.openshift.io/ingressNamespace=<service_namespace> \ 2
     -n knative-serving-ingress -o yaml \
         | grep -e "<label_name>: \"<label_value>\""  -e "<annotation_name>: <annotation_value>" 3
```

Use the name of your service.
Use the namespace where your service was created.
Use your values for the label and annotation names and values.
