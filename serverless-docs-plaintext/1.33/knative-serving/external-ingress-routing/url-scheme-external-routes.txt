# URL scheme for external routes

The URL scheme of external routes defaults to HTTPS for enhanced security. This scheme is determined by the default-external-scheme key in the KnativeServing custom resource (CR) spec.

# Setting the URL scheme for external routes


```yaml
...
spec:
  config:
    network:
      default-external-scheme: "https"
...
```


You can override the default spec to use HTTP by modifying the default-external-scheme key:


```yaml
...
spec:
  config:
    network:
      default-external-scheme: "http"
...
```
