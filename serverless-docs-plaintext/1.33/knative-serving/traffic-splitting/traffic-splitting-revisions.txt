# Splitting traffic between revisions


After you create a serverless application, the application is displayed in the Topology view of the Developer perspective in the OpenShift Container Platform web console. The application revision is represented by the node, and the Knative service is indicated by a quadrilateral around the node.
Any new change in the code or the service configuration creates a new revision, which is a snapshot of the code at a given time. For a service, you can manage the traffic between the revisions of the service by splitting and routing it to the different revisions as required.

# Managing traffic between revisions by using the OpenShift Container Platform web console

* The OpenShift Serverless Operator and Knative Serving are installed on your cluster.
* You have logged in to the OpenShift Container Platform web console.

To split traffic between multiple revisions of an application in the Topology view:

1. Click the Knative service to see its overview in the side panel.
2. Click the Resources tab, to see a list of Revisions and Routes for the service.

3. Click the service, indicated by the S icon at the top of the side panel, to see an overview of the service details.
4. Click the YAML tab and modify the service configuration in the YAML editor, and click Save. For example, change the timeoutseconds from 300 to 301 . This change in the configuration triggers a new revision. In the Topology view, the latest revision is displayed and the Resources tab for the service now displays the two revisions.
5. In the Resources tab, click Set Traffic Distribution to see the traffic distribution dialog box:
1. Add the split traffic percentage portion for the two revisions in the Splits field.
2. Add tags to create custom URLs for the two revisions.
3. Click Save to see two nodes representing the two revisions in the Topology view.
