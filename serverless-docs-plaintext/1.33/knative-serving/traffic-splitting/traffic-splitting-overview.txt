# Traffic splitting overview



In a Knative application, traffic can be managed by creating a traffic split. A traffic split is configured as part of a route, which is managed by a Knative service.

![Traffic management for a Knative application]

Configuring a route allows requests to be sent to different revisions of a service. This routing is determined by the traffic spec of the Service object.

A traffic spec declaration consists of one or more revisions, each responsible for handling a portion of the overall traffic. The percentages of traffic routed to each revision must add up to 100%, which is ensured by a Knative validation.

The revisions specified in a traffic spec can either be a fixed, named revision, or can point to the “latest” revision, which tracks the head of the list of all revisions for the service. The "latest" revision is a type of floating reference that updates if a new revision is created. Each revision can have a tag attached that creates an additional access URL for that revision.

The traffic spec can be modified by:

* Editing the YAML of a Service object directly.
* Using the Knative (kn) CLI --traffic flag.
* Using the OpenShift Container Platform web console.

When you create a Knative service, it does not have any default traffic spec settings.
