# Full duplex support for HTTP/1

You can enable the HTTP/1 full duplex support for a service by configuring the features.knative.dev/http-full-duplex annotation.


[NOTE]
----
Verify your HTTP clients before enabling, as earlier version clients might not provide support for HTTP/1 full duplex.
----

The following example shows how you can use this annotation in a Knative Service YAML object at the revision spec level:


```yaml
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: example-service
  namespace: default
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        features.knative.dev/http-full-duplex: "Enabled"
...
```
