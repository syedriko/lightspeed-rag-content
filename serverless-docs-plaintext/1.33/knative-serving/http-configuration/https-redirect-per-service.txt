# HTTPS redirection per service

You can enable or disable HTTPS redirection for a service by configuring the networking.knative.dev/http-option annotation.

# Redirecting HTTPS for a service

The following example shows how you can use this annotation in a Knative Service YAML object:


```yaml
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: example
  namespace: default
  annotations:
    networking.knative.dev/http-protocol: "redirected"
spec:
  ...
```
