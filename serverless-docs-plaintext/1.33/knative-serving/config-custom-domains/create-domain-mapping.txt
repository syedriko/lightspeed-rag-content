# Custom domain mapping

You can customize the domain for your Knative service by mapping a custom domain name that you own to a Knative service. To map a custom domain name to a custom resource (CR), you must create a DomainMapping CR that maps to an Addressable target CR, such as a Knative service or a Knative route.

# Creating a custom domain mapping

You can customize the domain for your Knative service by mapping a custom domain name that you own to a Knative service. To map a custom domain name to a custom resource (CR), you must create a DomainMapping CR that maps to an Addressable target CR, such as a Knative service or a Knative route.

* The OpenShift Serverless Operator and Knative Serving are installed on your cluster.
* Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).
* You have created a project or have access to a project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in OpenShift Container Platform.
* You have created a Knative service and control a custom domain that you want to map to that service.

[NOTE]
----
Your custom domain must point to the IP address of the OpenShift Container Platform cluster.

1. Create a YAML file containing the DomainMapping CR in the same namespace as the target CR you want to map to:

```yaml
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1beta1
kind: DomainMapping
metadata:
 name: <domain_name> 1
 namespace: <namespace> 2
spec:
 ref:
   name: <target_name> 3
   kind: <target_type> 4
   apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
```

The custom domain name that you want to map to the target CR.
The namespace of both the DomainMapping CR and the target CR.
The name of the target CR to map to the custom domain.
The type of CR being mapped to the custom domain.
Example service domain mapping

```yaml
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1beta1
kind: DomainMapping
metadata:
 name: example.com
 namespace: default
spec:
 ref:
   name: showcase
   kind: Service
   apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
```

Example route domain mapping

```yaml
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1beta1
kind: DomainMapping
metadata:
 name: example.com
 namespace: default
spec:
 ref:
   name: example-route
   kind: Route
   apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
```

2. Apply the DomainMapping CR as a YAML file:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f <filename>
```
