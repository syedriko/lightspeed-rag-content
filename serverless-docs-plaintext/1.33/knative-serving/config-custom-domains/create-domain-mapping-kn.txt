# Custom domains for Knative services using the Knative CLI

You can customize the domain for your Knative service by mapping a custom domain name that you own to a Knative service. You can use the Knative (kn) CLI to create a DomainMapping custom resource (CR) that maps to an Addressable target CR, such as a Knative service or a Knative route.

# Creating a custom domain mapping by using the Knative CLI

* The OpenShift Serverless Operator and Knative Serving are installed on your cluster.
* You have created a Knative service or route, and control a custom domain that you want to map to that CR.

[NOTE]
----
Your custom domain must point to the DNS of the OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
----
* You have installed the Knative (kn) CLI.
* You have created a project or have access to a project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in OpenShift Container Platform.

* Map a domain to a CR in the current namespace:

```terminal
$ kn domain create <domain_mapping_name> --ref <target_name>
```

Example command

```terminal
$ kn domain create example.com --ref showcase
```


The --ref flag specifies an Addressable target CR for domain mapping.

If a prefix is not provided when using the --ref flag, it is assumed that the target is a Knative service in the current namespace.
* Map a domain to a Knative service in a specified namespace:

```terminal
$ kn domain create <domain_mapping_name> --ref <ksvc:service_name:service_namespace>
```

Example command

```terminal
$ kn domain create example.com --ref ksvc:showcase:example-namespace
```

* Map a domain to a Knative route:

```terminal
$ kn domain create <domain_mapping_name> --ref <kroute:route_name>
```

Example command

```terminal
$ kn domain create example.com --ref kroute:example-route
```
