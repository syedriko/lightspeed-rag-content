# Configuring Kourier


Kourier is a lightweight Kubernetes-native Ingress for Knative Serving. Kourier acts as a gateway for Knative, routing HTTP traffic to Knative services.

# Customizing kourier-bootstrap for Kourier getaways

The Envoy proxy component in Kourier handles inbound and outbound HTTP traffic for the Knative services. By default, Kourier contains an Envoy bootstrap configuration in the kourier-bootstrap configuration map in the knative-serving-ingress namespace. You can change this configuration.

* You have installed the OpenShift Serverless Operator and Knative Serving.
* You have cluster administrator permissions on OpenShift Container Platform, or you have cluster or dedicated administrator permissions on Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS or OpenShift Dedicated.

* Specify a custom bootstrapping configuration map by changing the spec.ingress.kourier.bootstrap-configmap field in the KnativeServing custom resource (CR):
Example KnativeServing CR
