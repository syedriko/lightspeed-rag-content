# Init containers

Init containers are specialized containers that are run before application containers in a pod. They are generally used to implement initialization logic for an application, which may include running setup scripts or downloading required configurations. You can enable the use of init containers for Knative services by modifying the KnativeServing custom resource (CR).

[NOTE]
----
Init containers may cause longer application start-up times and should be used with caution for serverless applications, which are expected to scale up and down frequently.

# Enabling init containers

* You have installed OpenShift Serverless Operator and Knative Serving on your cluster.
* You have cluster administrator permissions on OpenShift Container Platform, or you have cluster or dedicated administrator permissions on Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS or OpenShift Dedicated.

* Enable the use of init containers by adding the kubernetes.podspec-init-containers flag to the KnativeServing CR:
Example KnativeServing CR

```yaml
apiVersion: operator.knative.dev/v1beta1
kind: KnativeServing
metadata:
  name: knative-serving
spec:
  config:
    features:
      kubernetes.podspec-init-containers: enabled
...
```
