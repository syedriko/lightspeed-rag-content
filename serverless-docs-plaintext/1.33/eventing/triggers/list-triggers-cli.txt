# List triggers from the command line

Using the Knative (kn) CLI to list triggers provides a streamlined and intuitive user interface.

# Listing triggers by using the Knative CLI

You can use the kn trigger list command to list existing triggers in your cluster.

* The OpenShift Serverless Operator and Knative Eventing are installed on your OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* You have installed the Knative (kn) CLI.

1. Print a list of available triggers:

```terminal
$ kn trigger list
```

Example output

```terminal
NAME    BROKER    SINK           AGE   CONDITIONS   READY   REASON
email   default   ksvc:edisplay   4s    5 OK / 5     True
ping    default   ksvc:edisplay   32s   5 OK / 5     True
```

2. Optional: Print a list of triggers in JSON format:

```terminal
$ kn trigger list -o json
```
