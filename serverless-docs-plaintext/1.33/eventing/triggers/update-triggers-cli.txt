# Updating triggers from the command line

Using the Knative (kn) CLI to update triggers provides a streamlined and intuitive user interface.

# Updating a trigger by using the Knative CLI

You can use the kn trigger update command with certain flags to update attributes for a trigger.

* The OpenShift Serverless Operator and Knative Eventing are installed on your OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* You have installed the Knative (kn) CLI.
* You have created a project or have access to a project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in OpenShift Container Platform.

* Update a trigger:

```terminal
$ kn trigger update <trigger_name> --filter <key=value> --sink <sink_name> [flags]
```

* You can update a trigger to filter exact event attributes that match incoming events. For example, using the type attribute:

```terminal
$ kn trigger update <trigger_name> --filter type=knative.dev.event
```

* You can remove a filter attribute from a trigger. For example, you can remove the filter attribute with key type:

```terminal
$ kn trigger update <trigger_name> --filter type-
```

* You can use the --sink parameter to change the event sink of a trigger:

```terminal
$ kn trigger update <trigger_name> --sink ksvc:my-event-sink
```
