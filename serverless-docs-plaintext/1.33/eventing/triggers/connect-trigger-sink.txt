# Connecting a trigger to a sink

You can connect a trigger to a sink, so that events from a broker are filtered before they are sent to the sink. A sink that is connected to a trigger is configured as a subscriber in the Trigger object&#8217;s resource spec.


```yaml
apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1
kind: Trigger
metadata:
  name: <trigger_name> 1
spec:
...
  subscriber:
    ref:
      apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1alpha1
      kind: KafkaSink
      name: <kafka_sink_name> 2
```


The name of the trigger being connected to the sink.
The name of a KafkaSink object.
