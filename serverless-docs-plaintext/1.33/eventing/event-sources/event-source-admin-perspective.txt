# Event source in the Administrator perspective

Sourcing events is critical to developing a distributed system that reacts to events.

# Creating an event source by using the Administrator perspective

A Knative event source can be any Kubernetes object that generates or imports cloud events, and relays those events to another endpoint, known as a sink.

* The OpenShift Serverless Operator and Knative Eventing are installed on your OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* You have logged in to the web console and are in the Administrator perspective.
* You have cluster administrator permissions on OpenShift Container Platform, or you have cluster or dedicated administrator permissions on Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS or OpenShift Dedicated.

1. In the Administrator perspective of the OpenShift Container Platform web console, navigate to Serverless -> Eventing.
2. In the Create list, select Event Source. You will be directed to the Event Sources page.
3. Select the event source type that you want to create.
