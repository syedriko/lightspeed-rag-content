# Connecting an event source to an event sink by using the Developer perspective

When you create an event source by using the OpenShift Container Platform web console, you can specify a target event sink that events are sent to from that source. The event sink can be any addressable or callable resource that can receive incoming events from other resources.

# Connect an event source to an event sink by using the Developer perspective

* The OpenShift Serverless Operator, Knative Serving, and Knative Eventing are installed on your OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
* You have logged in to the web console and are in the Developer perspective.
* You have created a project or have access to a project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in OpenShift Container Platform.
* You have created an event sink, such as a Knative service, channel or broker.

1. Create an event source of any type, by navigating to +Add -> Event Source and selecting the event source type that you want to create.
2. In the Target section of the Create Event Source form view, select your event sink. This can be either a Resource or a URI:
1. Select Resource to use a channel, broker, or service as an event sink for the event source.
2. Select URI to specify a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) where the events are routed to.
3. Click Create.

You can verify that the event source was created and is connected to the sink by viewing the Topology page.

1. In the Developer perspective, navigate to Topology.
2. View the event source and click the connected event sink to see the sink details in the right panel.
