# Event sources



A Knative event source can be any Kubernetes object that generates or imports cloud events, and relays those events to another endpoint, known as a sink. Sourcing events is critical to developing a distributed system that reacts to events.

You can create and manage Knative event sources by using the Developer perspective in the OpenShift Container Platform web console, the Knative (kn) CLI, or by applying YAML files.

Currently, OpenShift Serverless supports the following event source types:

API server source:: Brings Kubernetes API server events into Knative. The API server source sends a new event each time a Kubernetes resource is created, updated or deleted.
Ping source:: Produces events with a fixed payload on a specified cron schedule.
Kafka event source:: Connects an Apache Kafka cluster to a sink as an event source.

You can also create a custom event source.
