# Configuring ContainerSource with Service Mesh

This procedure describes how to configure container source with Service Mesh.

* You have set up integration of Service Mesh and Serverless.

1. Create a Service in a namespace that is member of the ServiceMeshMemberRoll:
Example event-display-service.yaml configuration file

```yaml
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: event-display
  namespace: <namespace> 1
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        sidecar.istio.io/inject: "true" 2
        sidecar.istio.io/rewriteAppHTTPProbers: "true"
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: quay.io/openshift-knative/knative-eventing-sources-event-display:latest
```

A namespace that is a member of the ServiceMeshMemberRoll.
This annotation injects Service Mesh sidecars into the Knative service pods.
2. Apply the Service resource:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f event-display-service.yaml
```

3. Create a ContainerSource object in a namespace that is member of the ServiceMeshMemberRoll and sink set to the event-display:
Example test-heartbeats-containersource.yaml configuration file

```yaml
apiVersion: sources.knative.dev/v1
kind: ContainerSource
metadata:
  name: test-heartbeats
  namespace: <namespace> 1
spec:
  template:
    metadata: 2
      annotations:
        sidecar.istio.io/inject": "true"
        sidecar.istio.io/rewriteAppHTTPProbers: "true"
    spec:
      containers:
        # This corresponds to a heartbeats image URI that you have built and published
        - image: quay.io/openshift-knative/heartbeats
          name: heartbeats
          args:
            - --period=1s
          env:
            - name: POD_NAME
              value: "example-pod"
            - name: POD_NAMESPACE
              value: "event-test"
  sink:
    ref:
      apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
      kind: Service
      name: event-display-service
```

A namespace that is part of the ServiceMeshMemberRoll.
These annotations enable Service Mesh integration with the ContainerSource object.
4. Apply the ContainerSource resource:

```terminal
$ oc apply -f test-heartbeats-containersource.yaml
```

5. Optional: Verify that the events were sent to the Knative event sink by looking at the message dumper function logs:
Example command

```terminal
$ oc logs $(oc get pod -o name | grep event-display) -c user-container
```

Example output

```terminal
