# Listing event source types from the command line

Using the Knative (kn) CLI provides a streamlined and intuitive user interface to view available event source types on your cluster.

# Listing available event source types by using the Knative CLI

You can list event source types that can be created and used on your cluster by using the kn source list-types CLI command.

* The OpenShift Serverless Operator and Knative Eventing are installed on the cluster.
* You have installed the Knative (kn) CLI.

1. List the available event source types in the terminal:

```terminal
$ kn source list-types
```

Example output

```terminal
TYPE              NAME                                            DESCRIPTION
ApiServerSource   apiserversources.sources.knative.dev            Watch and send Kubernetes API events to a sink
PingSource        pingsources.sources.knative.dev                 Periodically send ping events to a sink
SinkBinding       sinkbindings.sources.knative.dev                Binding for connecting a PodSpecable to a sink
```

2. Optional: On OpenShift Container Platform, you can also list the available event source types in YAML format:

```terminal
$ kn source list-types -o yaml
```
