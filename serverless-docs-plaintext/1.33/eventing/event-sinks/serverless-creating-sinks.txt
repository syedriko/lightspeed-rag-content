# Creating event sinks



When you create an event source, you can specify an event sink where events are sent to from the source. An event sink is an addressable or a callable resource that can receive incoming events from other resources. Knative services, channels, and brokers are all examples of event sinks. There is also a specific Apache Kafka sink type available.

For information about creating resources that can be used as event sinks, see the following documentation:
