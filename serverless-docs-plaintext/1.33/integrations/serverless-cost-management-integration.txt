# Integrating Serverless with the cost management service


Cost management is an OpenShift Container Platform service that enables you to better understand and track costs for clouds and containers. It is based on the open source Koku project.

# Prerequisites

* You have cluster administrator permissions.
* You have set up cost management and added an OpenShift Container Platform source.

# Using labels for cost management queries

Labels, also known as tags in cost management, can be applied for nodes, namespaces or pods. Each label is a key and value pair. You can use a combination of multiple labels to generate reports. You can access reports about costs by using the Red Hat hybrid console.

Labels are inherited from nodes to namespaces, and from namespaces to pods. However, labels are not overridden if they already exist on a resource. For example, Knative services have a default app=<revision_name> label:


```yaml
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: showcase
spec:
...
      labels:
        app: <revision_name>
...
```


If you define a label for a namespace, such as app=my-domain, the cost management service does not take into account costs coming from a Knative service with the tag app=<revision_name> when querying the application using the app=my-domain tag. Costs for Knative services that have this tag must be queried under the app=<revision_name> tag.
