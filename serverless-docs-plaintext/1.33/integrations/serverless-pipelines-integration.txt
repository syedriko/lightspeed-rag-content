# Integrating Serverless with OpenShift Pipelines


Integrating Serverless with OpenShift Pipelines enables CI/CD pipeline management for Serverless services. Using this integration, you can automate the deployment of your Serverless services.

# Prerequisites

* You have access to the cluster with cluster-admin privileges.
* The OpenShift Serverless Operator and Knative Serving are installed on the cluster.
* You have installed the OpenShift Pipelines Operator on the cluster.

# Creating a service deployed by OpenShift Pipelines

Using the OpenShift Container Platform web console, you can create a service that the OpenShift Pipelines deploys.

1. In the OpenShift Container Platform web console Developer perspective, navigate to +Add and select the Import from Git option.

* Optional: Specify the application name. By default, the repository name is used.
* Select the Serverless Deployment resource type.
* Select the Add pipeline checkbox. The pipeline is automatically selected based on the source code and its visualization is shown on the scheme.
* Specify any other relevant settings.
