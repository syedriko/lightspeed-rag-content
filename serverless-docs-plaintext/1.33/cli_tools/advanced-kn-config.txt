# Configuring the Knative CLI



You can customize your Knative (kn) CLI setup by creating a config.yaml configuration file. You can provide this configuration by using the --config flag, otherwise the configuration is picked up from a default location. The default configuration location conforms to the XDG Base Directory Specification, and is different for UNIX systems and Windows systems.

For UNIX systems:

* If the XDG_CONFIG_HOME environment variable is set, the default configuration location that the Knative (kn) CLI looks for is $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/kn.
* If the XDG_CONFIG_HOME environment variable is not set, the Knative (kn) CLI looks for the configuration in the home directory of the user at $HOME/.config/kn/config.yaml.

For Windows systems, the default Knative (kn) CLI configuration location is %APPDATA%\kn.


```yaml
plugins:
  path-lookup: true 1
  directory: ~/.config/kn/plugins 2
eventing:
  sink-mappings: 3
  - prefix: svc 4
    group: core 5
    version: v1 6
    resource: services 7
```


Specifies whether the Knative (kn) CLI should look for plugins in the PATH environment variable. This is a boolean configuration option. The default value is false.
Specifies the directory where the Knative (kn) CLI looks for plugins. The default path depends on the operating system, as described previously. This can be any directory that is visible to the user.
The sink-mappings spec defines the Kubernetes addressable resource that is used when you use the --sink flag with a Knative (kn) CLI command.
The prefix you want to use to describe your sink. svc for a service, channel, and broker are predefined prefixes for the Knative (kn) CLI.
The API group of the Kubernetes resource.
The version of the Kubernetes resource.
The plural name of the Kubernetes resource type. For example, services or brokers.
