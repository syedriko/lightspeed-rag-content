# kn domain commands


You can use the following commands to create and manage domain mappings.

# Creating a custom domain mapping by using the Knative CLI

* The OpenShift Serverless Operator and Knative Serving are installed on your cluster.
* You have created a Knative service or route, and control a custom domain that you want to map to that CR.

[NOTE]
----
Your custom domain must point to the DNS of the OpenShift Container Platform cluster.
----
* You have installed the Knative (kn) CLI.
* You have created a project or have access to a project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in OpenShift Container Platform.

* Map a domain to a CR in the current namespace:

```terminal
$ kn domain create <domain_mapping_name> --ref <target_name>
```

Example command

```terminal
$ kn domain create example.com --ref showcase
```


The --ref flag specifies an Addressable target CR for domain mapping.

If a prefix is not provided when using the --ref flag, it is assumed that the target is a Knative service in the current namespace.
* Map a domain to a Knative service in a specified namespace:

```terminal
$ kn domain create <domain_mapping_name> --ref <ksvc:service_name:service_namespace>
```

Example command

```terminal
$ kn domain create example.com --ref ksvc:showcase:example-namespace
```

* Map a domain to a Knative route:

```terminal
$ kn domain create <domain_mapping_name> --ref <kroute:route_name>
```

Example command

```terminal
$ kn domain create example.com --ref kroute:example-route
```


# Managing custom domain mappings by using the Knative CLI

After you have created a DomainMapping custom resource (CR), you can list existing CRs, view information about an existing CR, update CRs, or delete CRs by using the Knative (kn) CLI.

* The OpenShift Serverless Operator and Knative Serving are installed on your cluster.
* You have created at least one DomainMapping CR.
* You have installed the Knative (kn) CLI tool.
* You have created a project or have access to a project with the appropriate roles and permissions to create applications and other workloads in OpenShift Container Platform.

* List existing DomainMapping CRs:

```terminal
$ kn domain list -n <domain_mapping_namespace>
```

* View details of an existing DomainMapping CR:

```terminal
$ kn domain describe <domain_mapping_name>
```

* Update a DomainMapping CR to point to a new target:

```terminal
$ kn domain update --ref <target>
```

* Delete a DomainMapping CR:

```terminal
$ kn domain delete <domain_mapping_name>
```
