# Examining metrics of a service

After you have configured the application to export the metrics and the monitoring stack to scrape them, you can examine the metrics in the web console.
* You have logged in to the OpenShift Container Platform web console.
* You have installed the OpenShift Serverless Operator and Knative Serving.
1. Optional: Run requests against your application that you will be able to see in the metrics:

```terminal
$ hello_route=$(oc get ksvc helloworld-go -n ns1 -o jsonpath='{.status.url}') && \
    curl $hello_route
```

Example output

```terminal
Hello Go Sample v1!
```

2. In the web console, navigate to the Observe -> Metrics interface.
3. In the input field, enter the query for the metric you want to observe, for example:

```
revision_app_request_count{namespace="ns1", job="helloworld-go-sm"}
```


Another example:

```
myapp_processed_ops_total{namespace="ns1", job="helloworld-go-sm"}
```

4. Observe the visualized metrics:
![Observing metrics of a service]
![Observing metrics of a service]

# Queue proxy metrics

Each Knative service has a proxy container that proxies the connections to the application container. A number of metrics are reported for the queue proxy performance.

You can use the following metrics to measure if requests are queued at the proxy side and the actual delay in serving requests at the application side.
