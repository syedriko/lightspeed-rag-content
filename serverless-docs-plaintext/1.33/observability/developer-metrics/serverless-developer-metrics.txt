# Serverless developer metrics overview


Metrics enable developers to monitor how Knative services are performing. You can use the OpenShift Container Platform monitoring stack to record and view health checks and metrics for your Knative services.
You can view different metrics for OpenShift Serverless by navigating to Dashboards in the  web console Developer perspective.

[WARNING]
----
If Service Mesh is enabled with mTLS, metrics for Knative Serving are disabled by default because Service Mesh prevents Prometheus from scraping metrics.
For information about resolving this issue, see Enabling Knative Serving metrics when using Service Mesh with mTLS.
Scraping the metrics does not affect autoscaling of a Knative service, because scraping requests do not go through the activator. Consequently, no scraping takes place if no pods are running.
