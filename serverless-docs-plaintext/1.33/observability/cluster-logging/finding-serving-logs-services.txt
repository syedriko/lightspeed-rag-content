# Finding logs for Knative Serving services

You can find the logs for Knative Serving services using the following procedure.

# Using OpenShift Logging to find logs for services deployed with Knative Serving

With OpenShift Logging, the logs that your applications write to the console are collected in Elasticsearch. The following procedure outlines how to apply these capabilities to applications deployed by using Knative Serving.

* Install the OpenShift CLI (oc).

1. Get the Kibana route:

```terminal
$ oc -n openshift-logging get route kibana
```

2. Use the route's URL to navigate to the Kibana dashboard and log in.
3. Check that the index is set to .all. If the index is not set to .all, only the OpenShift system logs will be listed.
4. Filter the logs by using the knative-serving namespace. Enter a filter for the service in the search box to filter results.
Example filter

```terminal
kubernetes.namespace_name:default AND kubernetes.labels.serving_knative_dev\/service:{service_name}
```


You can also filter by using /configuration or /revision.
5. Narrow your search by using kubernetes.container_name:<user_container> to only display the logs generated by your application. Otherwise, you will see logs from the queue-proxy.


[NOTE]
----
Use JSON-based structured logging in your application to allow for the quick filtering of these logs in production environments.
