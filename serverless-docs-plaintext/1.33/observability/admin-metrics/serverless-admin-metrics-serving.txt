# Knative Serving metrics


Cluster administrators can view the following metrics for Knative Serving components.

# Activator metrics

You can use the following metrics to understand how applications respond when traffic passes through the activator.



# Autoscaler metrics

The autoscaler component exposes a number of metrics related to autoscaler behavior for each revision. For example, at any given time, you can monitor the targeted number of pods the autoscaler tries to allocate for a service, the average number of requests per second during the stable window, or whether the autoscaler is in panic mode if you are using the Knative pod autoscaler (KPA).



# Go runtime metrics

Each Knative Serving control plane process emits a number of Go runtime memory statistics (MemStats).
