Presets

Introduction

If you often use tools with particular settings, presets are for you.
Presets are saved settings for a tool that you can easily restore when
needed. You can give each preset its own name to make it easier to
choose the preset you need.

Four buttons at the bottom of all tool options dialogs allow you to
[save](#gimp-tool-options-save), [restore](#gimp-tool-options-restore),
[delete](#gimp-tool-options-delete), or
[reset](#gimp-tool-options-reset) presets.

An overview of all tool presets is available in the [Tool Presets
Dialog](#gimp-tool-preset-dialog). From there you can select and update
individual presets.
