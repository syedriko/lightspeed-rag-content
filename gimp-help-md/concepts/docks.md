### Organizing Dialogs {#gimp-dockable-dock-bars}

GIMP has great flexibility for arranging dialogs on your screen. A
"dialog" is a moving window which contains options for a tool or is
dedicated to a special task. A "dock" is a container which can hold a
collection of persistent dialogs, such as the Tool Options dialog,
Brushes dialog, Palette dialog, etc. Docks cannot, however, hold
non-persistent dialogs such as the Preferences dialog or the image
window.

GIMP has three default docks:

-   the Tool Options, Device Status, Undo History and Images dock under
    the Toolbox in the left panel,

-   the Brushes, Patterns, Fonts and Document History dock in the upper
    part of the right panel,

-   the Layers, Channels and Paths dock in the lower part of the right
    panel.

In these docks, each dialog is in its own tab.

In multi-window mode, the Toolbox is a *utility window* and not a dock.
In single-window mode, it belongs to the single window.

Use [Windows \> Dockable Dialogs]{.menuchoice} to view a list of
dockable dialogs. Select a dockable dialog from the list to view the
dialog. If the dialog is available in a dock, then it is made visible.
If the dialog is not in a dock, the behavior is different in multi and
single window modes:

-   In multi-window mode, a new window, containing the dialog, appears
    on the screen.

-   In single-window mode, the dialog is automatically docked to the
    Brushes-Document History dock as a tab.

You can click-and-drag a tab and drop it in the wanted place:

-   either in the tab bar of a dock, to integrate it in the dialog
    group,

-   or on a docking bar that appears as a blue line when the mouse
    pointer goes over a dock border, to anchor the dialog to the dock.

In multi-window mode, you can also click on the dialog title and drag it
to the wanted place.

More simple: the `Add tab` command in the Tab menu [Tab
Menu](#gimp-dockable-menu).

<img src="images/using/dock-anchor-dialog.png"
alt="The Histogram dialog dragged to the left vertical docking bar of the right panel and the result: the dialog anchored to the left border of the right panel. This dialog now belongs to the right panel. So, you can arrange dialogs in a multi-column display, interesting if you work with two screens, one for dialogs, the other for images." />

::: tip
Press the Tab key in the image window to toggle the visibility of the
docks. This is useful if the docks hide a portion of the image window.
You can quickly hide all the docks, do your work, then display all the
docks again. Press the Tab key inside a dock to navigate through the
dock.

### Tab Menu {#gimp-dockable-menu}

Docks

Tab menu

In each dialog, you can access a special menu of tab-related operations
by pressing the Tab Menu button
![](images/stock-icons/gimp-menu-left.svg) . The exact commands shown in
the menu depend on the active dialog, but they always include operations
for creating new tabs, closing or detaching tabs.

<p><img src="images/using/tab-menu-single-window-mode.png"
alt="Single-window mode" /></p>
<figcaption>The Tab menu of the Layers dialog.</figcaption>
</figure>

The Tab menu gives you access to the following commands:

Context Menu
:   Docks
    Context Menu
    At the top of each Tab menu, an entry opens the dialog\'s context
    menu, which contains operations specific to that particular type of
    dialog. For example, the context menu for the Layers tab is Layers
    Menu, which contains a set of operations for manipulating layers.

Add Tab
:   Docks
    Add Tab
    Add Tab opens into a submenu allowing you to add a large variety of
    dockable dialogs as new tabs.

    !["Add tab" submenu](images/using/tab-menu-add-tab.png)

Close Tab
:   Docks
    Close tab
    Close the dockable dialog. Closing the last dialog in a dock causes
    the dock itself to close.

Detach Tab
:   Docks
    Detach tab
    Detach the dialog from the dock, creating a new dock with the
    detached dialog as its only member. It has the same effect as
    dragging the tab out of the dock and releasing it at a location
    where it cannot be docked.

    It\'s a way to create a paradoxical new window in single-window
    mode!

    If the tab is [locked](#gimp-dock-tab-lock), this menu item is
    disabled.

Lock Tab to Dock
:   Docks
    Lock tab
    Prevent the dialog from being moved or detached. When activated,
    Detach Tab is disabled.

Preview Size
:   Previews
    Tab preview size
    Layer
    Preview size
    Docks
    Preview size
    Many, but not all, dialogs have Tab menus containing a Preview Size
    option, which opens a submenu giving a list of sizes for the items
    in the dialog, from small to large. For example, the Brushes dialog
    shows pictures of all available brushes: the Preview Size determines
    how large the pictures are. The default is Medium size.

Tab Style
:   Docks
    Tab style
    Tab Style opens a submenu allowing you to choose the appearance of
    the tabs at the top. There are five choices, but not all are enabled
    for every dialog:

    Icon

    :   Use an icon to represent the dialog type.

    Current Status

    :   Is only available for dialogs that allows you to select
        something, such as a brush, pattern, gradient, etc. Current
        Status shows a representation of the currently selected item in
        the tab top.

    Text

    :   Use text to display the dialog type.

    Icon and Text

    :   Using both an icon and text results in wider tabs.

    Status and Text

    :   Show the currently selected item and text with the dialog type.

View as List; View as Grid
:   Docks
    View as List/Grid
    List search field
    These entries are shown in dialogs that allow you to select an item
    from a set: brushes, patterns, fonts, etc. You can choose to view
    the items as a vertical list, with the name of each beside it, or as
    a grid, with representations of the items but no names. Each has its
    advantages: viewing as a list gives you more information, but
    viewing as a grid allows you to see more possibilities at once. The
    default for this varies across dialogs: for brushes and patterns,
    the default is a grid; for most other things, the default is a list.

    When the tree-view is View as List, you can use tags. Please see
    [???](#gimp-tagging).

    You can also use a list search field:

    <figure>
    <img src="images/using/list-search-field.png"
    alt="Press Ctrl+F to open the list search field, displayed at the bottom. An item must be selected for this command to be effective." />
    <figcaption>The list search field.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    The list search field automatically closes after five seconds if you
    do nothing.

    ::: note
    The search field shortcut is also available for the tree-view you
    get in the "Brush", "Font" or "Pattern" option of several tools.

Show Button Bar

:   Some dialogs display a button bar on the bottom of the dialog; for
    example, the Patterns, Brushes, Gradients, and Images dialogs. This
    is a toggle. If it is checked, then the Button Bar is displayed.

    ![Button Bar on the Brushes
    dialog.](images/using/dialog-button-bar.png)

Show Image Selection

:   This option is available in multi-window mode only. This is a
    toggle. If it is checked, then the active image is shown at the top
    of the dock:

    ![A dock with the Image Menu
    highlighted.](images/using/dialog-highlight-imagemenu.png){#figure-highlight-imagemenu}

    It is not available for dialogs docked below the Toolbox. This
    option is interesting only if you have several open images on your
    screen.

Auto Follow Active Image

:   This option is available in multi-window mode only. This option is
    also interesting only if you have several images open on your
    screen. Then, the information displayed in a dock is always that of
    the selected image in the Image Selection drop-down list. If the
    Auto Follow Active Image is disabled, the image can be selected only
    in the Image Selection. If enabled, you can also select it by
    activating the image directly (clicking on its title bar).

Move to Screen

:   The option Open Display... is an experimental functionality to
    choose a different display.
