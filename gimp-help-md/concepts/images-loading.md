Open

There are several ways of opening an existing image in GIMP:

Open Image dialog

:   The most obvious way to open an existing image is the Open Image
    dialog. Use [File \> Open...]{.menuchoice}, or [Ctrl+O]{.keycombo}
    to open the [Open Image](#gimp-open-dialog) dialog. This dialog
    allows you to navigate to the image you want to use, select its
    name, and then use the Open button to load the image. For details on
    how to use this dialog, see the above link.

    The Open Image dialog provides several features to help you navigate
    quickly to a file. Perhaps the most important is the ability to
    create "bookmarks", for folders that you use often.

Open Location

:   You can directly open an image from an online or network location if
    you know the URI (i.e., a web or network address) for the image.
    Select [File \> Open Location...]{.menuchoice} from the main menu.
    For more details, see the [Open
    Location...](#gimp-file-open-location) documentation.

Open Recent

:   To open an image that was recently used in GIMP, select [File \>
    Open Recent]{.menuchoice} from the main menu. This displays a
    submenu of the most recently opened images that you can click to
    open the desired image. At the bottom of this submenu is the
    [Document History](#gimp-document-dialog) command if you need to
    reopen an image from longer ago. See also [Open
    Recent](#gimp-file-open-recent).

File Manager

:   If you have associated an image file type with GIMP, either when you
    installed GIMP or later, then you can navigate to the file using a
    file manager (such as Nautilus or Konqueror in Linux, or Windows
    Explorer in Windows), and once you have found it, double-click on
    the file. If properly configured, the image will open in GIMP. Most
    file managers also support drag and drop (see below).

Drag and Drop

:   You can "Drag and drop" one or more images onto the
    [Toolbox](#gimp-concepts-toolbox), or, if you haven\'t opened any
    images yet, the empty image window, to open the dragged image or
    images.

    You can also drag one or more images into an open GIMP image. The
    dropped image or images will be added to the open image as a new
    layer, or set of layers.

    Many applications support dragging and dropping an image into GIMP;
    for example, drag an image from Firefox and drop it onto GIMP\'s
    toolbox.

Copy and Paste

:   Use [File \> Create \> From Clipboard]{.menuchoice} (see [From
    Clipboard](#gimp-file-create-clipboard)) to create a new image from
    the clipboard; alternatively, you can use [Edit \> Paste as \> Paste
    as New Image]{.menuchoice} (see [Paste as New
    Image](#gimp-edit-paste-as-new-image)). Many applications support
    copying an image to the clipboard that can then be pasted into GIMP.
    Many operating systems support copying screen content to the
    clipboard.

    Print Screen typically copies the screen content to the clipboard.
    Print screen is not universally supported, and just because your
    operating system can copy an image to the clipboard, does not mean
    that GIMP can use the image from the clipboard. Your best bet is to
    try it and see if it works.

Image Browser

:   There are many image management applications that can be used to
    browse and manage your images. They usually work similar to a normal
    file browser in that you can double click images to load them in
    their default application; or you can use drag-and-drop to drop one
    or more images on GIMP\'s toolbox.

    Example applications on Linux are: gThumb; see the gThumb website
    [???](#bibliography-online-gthumb). Another similar application is
    Geeqie [???](#bibliography-online-geeqie).
