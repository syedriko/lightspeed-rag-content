Toolbox

Introduction

![Screenshot of the Toolbox](images/using/toolbox-description.png)

The Toolbox is the heart of GIMP. Here is a quick tour of what you will
find there.

::: tip
In the Toolbox, as in most parts of GIMP, moving the mouse over
something and letting it rest for a moment, usually displays a "tooltip"
that describes the thing. Short cut keys are also frequently shown in
the tooltip. In many cases, you can hover the mouse over an item and
press the F1 key to get help about the thing that is underneath the
mouse.

By default, only the Foreground/Background Colors area is visible. You
can add the Brush/Pattern/Gradient area and Active Image area through
[Edit \> Preferences \> Toolbox]{.menuchoice}:
[???](#prefs-tools-config).

1.  *The GIMP logo:* At the top of the toolbox, you can
    click-drag-and-drop images from a file browser into this area or
    into the tool icons to open the images. You can hide this logo by
    unchecking the Show GIMP logo option in the [Toolbox
    Preferences](#gimp-prefs-toolbox).

2.  *Tool icons:* These icons are buttons which activate tools for a
    wide variety of purposes: selecting parts of images, painting an
    image, transforming an image, etc. [???](#gimp-toolbox) gives an
    overview of how to work with tools, and each tool is described
    systematically in the [Tools](#gimp-tools) chapter.

3.  *Foreground/Background colors:*

    The color area shows GIMP\'s current foreground and background
    colors, which are used for painting, filling, and many other
    operations. Clicking on either one of them brings up a color
    selector dialog that allows you to change to a different color.

    Clicking on the small symbol in the lower left corner resets the
    foreground and background colors to black and white. Pressing the D
    key has the same effect.

    Clicking on the double-headed arrow symbol swaps the foreground and
    background colors. Pressing the X key has the same effect.

4.  *Brush/Pattern/Gradient:* The symbols here show you GIMP\'s current
    selections for: the Paintbrush, used by all tools that allow you to
    paint on the image ("painting" includes operations like erasing and
    smudging, by the way); for the Pattern, which is used in filling
    selected areas of an image; and for the Gradient, which comes into
    play whenever an operation requires a smoothly varying range of
    colors. Clicking on any of these symbols brings up a dialog window
    that allows you to change it.

5.  *Active Image:* In GIMP, you can work with many images at once, but
    at any given moment, only one image is the "active image". Here you
    find a small iconic representation of the active image. Click the
    icon to display a dialog with a list of the currently open images,
    click an image in the dialog to make it active. Usually, you click
    an image window in multi-window mode, or an image tab in
    single-window mode, to make it the active image.

    []{.indexterm} If you use GIMP on a Unix-like operating system with
    the X Window System, you can also drag and drop the thumbnail to an
    enabled [XDS file manager](#bibliography-online-xds) to directly
    save the corresponding image.

::: note
At every start, GIMP selects the brush, color, pattern you used when
quitting your previous session because the Save input device settings on
exit in [Preferences/Input Devices](#gimp-prefs-input-devices), is
checked by default. If you uncheck it, GIMP will use a color, a brush
and a pattern by default, always the same.
