## Creating animated brushes {#gimp-using-animated-brushes}

Animation

Creating an animated brush

Just like for normal brushes, these animated brushes can also be either
grayscale or color. For grayscale images, where the actual brush will
use the current foreground color, you use white for transparency. For
color images, transparent parts are used as such and when making brush
strokes, the actual colors will be used instead of the foreground color.

To create a new animated brush, create either a grayscale or color
image, based on whether you want the brush to use the user\'s foreground
color, or the actual colors in the image. Then create the images for
your animation steps. To save the brush into gih format, select [File \>
Export As...]{.menuchoice}, name your work with the gih extension, and
press the Export button. The following window is displayed:

</figure>

This dialog box has several options that allow you to select how your
brush is animated.

Spacing (Percent)

:   "Spacing" is the distance between consecutive brush marks when you
    trace out a brushstroke with the pointer. You must consider drawing
    with a brush, whatever the paint tool, like stamping. If Spacing is
    low, stamps will be very close and stroke look continuous. If
    spacing is high, stamps will be separated: that\'s interesting with
    a color brush (like "green pepper" for instance). Value varies from
    1 to 200 and this percentage refers to brush "diameter": 100% is one
    diameter.

Description

:   It\'s the brush name that will appear at the top of Brush Dialog
    (grid mode) when the brush is selected.

Cell Size

:   That is size of cells you will cut up in layers. Default is one cell
    per layer and size is that of the layer. Then there is only one
    brush aspect per layer.

    We could have only one big layer and cut up in it the cells that
    will be used for the different aspects of the animated brush.

    For instance, we want a 100×100 pixels brush with 8 different
    aspects. We can take these 8 aspects from a 400×200 pixels layer, or
    from a 300×300 pixels layer but with one cell unused.

Number of cells

:   That\'s the number of cells (one cell per aspect) that will be cut
    in every layer. Default is the number of layers as there is only one
    layer per aspect.

Display as

:   This tells how cells have been arranged in layers. If, for example,
    you have placed height cells at the rate of two cells per layer on
    four layers, GIMP will display: `1 rows of 2 columns on each layer`.

Dimension; Ranks; Selection dropdown

:   There things are getting complicated! Explanations are necessary to
    understand how to arrange cell and layers.

    GIMP starts retrieving cells from each layer and stacks them into a
    FIFO stack (First In First Out: the first in is at the top of the
    stack and so can be first out). In our example 4 layers with 2 cells
    in each, we\'ll have, from top to bottom: first cell of first layer,
    second cell of first layer, first cell of second layer, second cell
    of second layer, ..., second cell of fourth layer. With one cell per
    layer or with several cells per layer, result is the same. You can
    see this stack in the [Layers Dialog](#gimp-layer-dialog) of the
    resulting `.gih` image file.

    Then GIMP creates a computer array from this stack with the
    Dimensions you have set. You can use four dimensions.

    In computer science an array has a "myarray(x,y,z)" form for a 3
    dimensions array (3D). It\'s easy to imagine a 2D array: on a paper
    it\'s an array with rows and columns

    ![](images/using/gih-array2D.png)

    With a 3d array we don\'t talk rows and columns but Dimensions and
    Ranks. The first dimension is along x axis, the second dimension
    along y axis, the third along z axis. Each dimension has ranks of
    cells.

    ![](images/using/gih-array3D.png)

    To fill up this array, GIMP starts retrieving cells from the top of
    stack. The way it fills the array reminds that of an odometer: right
    rank digits turn first and, when they reach their maximum, left rank
    digits start running. If you have some memories of Basic programming
    you will have, with an array(4,2,2), the following succession:
    (1,1,1),(1,1,2),(1,2,1),(1,2,2),(2,1,1),(2,1,2),(2,2,2),(3,1,1),...,
    (4,2,2). We will see this later in an example.

    Besides the rank number that you can give to each dimension, you can
    also give them a Selection mode. You have several modes that will be
    applied when drawing:

    Incremental

    :   GIMP selects a rank from the concerned dimension according to
        the order ranks have in that dimension.

    Angular

    :   GIMP selects a rank in the concerned dimension according to the
        moving angle of the brush.

        The first rank is for the direction 0°, upwards. The other ranks
        are affected, clockwise, to an angle whose value is 360/number
        of ranks. So, with 4 ranks in the concerned dimension, the angle
        will move 90° clockwise for each direction change: second rank
        will be affected to 90° (rightwards), third rank to 180°
        (downwards) and fourth rank to 270° (-90°) (leftwards).

    Random

    :   GIMP selects a rank at random from the concerned dimension.

    Velocity; Pressure; Xtilt; Ytilt

    :   These options are for sophisticated drawing tablets.

A one dimension image pipe

:   Well! What is all this useful for? We\'ll see that gradually with
    examples. You can actually place in each dimension cases that will
    give your brush a particular action.

    Let us start with a 1D brush which will allow us to study selection
    modes action. We can imagine it like this:

    ![](images/using/gih-array1D.png)

    Follow these steps:

    -   Select [File \> New...]{.menuchoice} from the main menu.

        Set Width and Height for example to 30 pixels.

        In the Advanced Options, set the Color space to RGB color and
        set Fill with to Transparency.

        Using the Text tool create 4 layers "1", "2", "3", "4". Delete
        the "background" layer.

    -   Select [File \> Save...]{.menuchoice} from the main menu to
        first save your image as an `.xcf` file to keep its properties.

        Select [File \> Export As...]{.menuchoice} from the main menu to
        export the image as an animated brush with the `.gih` extension.

        Export the image with a `.gbr` extension in the `brushes`
        directory located inside [your personal GIMP configuration
        folder](#gimp-concepts-setup).

    -   In the Export Image as Brush Pipe dialog, provide a Description,
        set the Spacing (percent) to 100, set the Cell size to 30×30,
        set Dimension to 1, and set Ranks to 4, and the Selection
        drop-down to incremental. Then click the Export button.

    -   In the [Brush Dialog](#gimp-brush-dialog), click on the button
        Refresh brushes ![](images/stock-icons/view-refresh.svg) .

        Your brush appears among the other brushes. You can use it
        immediately, without restarting GIMP.

        Select your brush. Select pencil tool for instance and click and
        hold with it on a new image:

        ![You see 1, 2, 3, 4 digits following one another in
        order.](images/using/gih1234incr.png)

    -   Take your `.xcf` image file back and export it as `.gih` setting
        the Selection drop-down to random:

        ![Digits will be displayed at random
        order.](images/using/gih1234rand.png)

    -   Now set the Selection drop-down to angular:

        ![](images/using/gih1234angl.png)

A 3 dimensions image hose

:   We are now going to create a 3D animated brush: its orientation will
    vary according to brush direction, it will alternate Left/Right
    hands regularly and its color will vary at random between black and
    blue.

    The first question we have to answer to is the number of images that
    is necessary. We reserve the first dimension (x) to the brush
    direction (4 directions). The second dimension (y) is for Left/Right
    alternation and the third dimension (z) for color variation. Such a
    brush is represented in a 3D array "myarray(4,2,2)":

    ![](images/using/gih-3Dnum.png)

    There are 4 ranks in first dimension (x), 2 ranks in second
    dimension (y) and 2 ranks in third dimension (z). Thus there are
    4×2×2 = 16 cells. We need 16 images.

    -   Open a new 30×30 pixels image, RGB with Transparent Fill Type.
        Using the zoom draw a left hand with fingers upwards.[^1] Save
        it as `handL0k.xcf` (hand Left 0° Black).

        Open the [Layers Dialog](#gimp-layer-dialog). Double click on
        the layer to open the Layer Attributes Dialog and rename it to
        handL0k.

        Duplicate the layer. Let visible only the duplicated layer,
        select it and apply [Layer \> Transform \> Rotate 90°
        clockwise]{.menuchoice}. Rename it to handL90k.

        Repeat the same operations to create handL180k and handL-90k (or
        handL270k).

    -   This dimension in our example has two ranks, one for left hand
        and the other for right hand. The left hand rank exists yet. We
        shall build right hand images by flipping it horizontally.

        Duplicate the handL0k layer. Let it visible only and select it.
        Rename it to handR0K. Apply [Layer \> Transform \> Flip
        Horizontally]{.menuchoice}.

        Repeat the same operation on the other left hand layers to
        create their right hand equivalent.

        Re-order layers to have a clockwise rotation from top to bottom,
        alternating Left and Right: handL0k, handR0k, handL90k,
        handR90k, ..., handR-90k.

    -   *Creating images of dimension 3 (z)*: The third dimension has
        two ranks, one for black color and the other for blue color. The
        first rank, black, exists yet. We well see that images of
        dimension 3 will be a copy, in blue, of the images of
        dimension 2. So we will have our 16 images. But a row of 16
        layers is not easy to manage: we will use layers with two
        images.

        Select the handL0k layer and let it visible only. Use [Image \>
        Canvas Size...]{.menuchoice} to [change the canvas
        size](#gimp-image-resize) to 60×30 pixels.

        Duplicate handL0k layer. On the copy, fill the hand with blue
        using Bucket Fill tool.

        Now, select the Move tool. Double click on it to accede to its
        properties: check Move the Current Layer option. Move the blue
        hand into the right part of the layer precisely with the help of
        Zoom.

        Make sure only handL0k and its blue copy are visible. Right
        click on the Layers dialog: Apply the Merge Visible Layers
        command with the option Expand as Necessary. You get a 60×30
        pixels layer with the black hand on the left and the blue hand
        on the right. Rename it to "handsL0".

        Repeat the same operations on the other layers.

    -   Layers must be set in order so that GIMP can find the required
        image at some point of using the brush. Our layers are yet in
        order but we must understand more generally how to have them in
        order. There are two ways to imagine this setting in order. The
        first method is mathematical: GIMP divides the 16 layers first
        by 4; that gives 4 groups of 4 layers for the first dimension.
        Each group represents a direction of the brush. Then, it divides
        each group by 2; that gives 8 groups of 2 layers for the second
        dimension: each group represents a L/R alternation. Then another
        division by 2 for the third dimension to represent a color at
        random between black and blue.

        The other method is visual, by using the array representation.
        Correlation between two methods is represented in next image:

        ![](images/using/gih-correlation.png)

        *How will GIMP read this array?*: GIMP starts with the first
        dimension which is programmed for "angular", for instance 90°.
        In this 90° rank, in yellow, in the second dimension, it selects
        a L/R alternation, in an "incremental" way. Then, in the third
        dimension, in a random way, it chooses a color. Finally, our
        layers must be in the following order:

        ![](images/using/gih-hands-layers.png)

    -   Voilà. Your brush is ready. Save it as `.xcf` first, then export
        as `.gih` with the following parameters:

        -   Spacing: 100

        -   Description: Hands

        -   Cell Size: 30×30

        -   Number of cells: 16

        -   Dimensions: 3

            -   Dimension 1: 4 ranks Selection: Angular

            -   Dimension 2: 2 ranks Selection: Incremental

            -   Dimension 3: 2 ranks Selection: Random

        Place your `.gih` file into the GIMP brush directory and refresh
        the brush box (see steps above). You can now use your brush.
