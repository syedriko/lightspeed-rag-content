Creating new layers

There are several ways to create new layers in an image. Here are the
most important ones:

-   Selecting [Layer \> New Layer...]{.menuchoice} in the main menu.
    This brings up a dialog that allows you to set the basic properties
    of the new layer; see the [New Layer dialog](#gimp-layer-new)
    section for help with it.

-   Selecting [Layer \> Duplicate Layers]{.menuchoice} in the main menu.
    This creates a new layer, that is a perfect copy of the currently
    active layer, just above the active layer.

-   When you "cut" or "copy" something, and then paste it using
    [Ctrl+V]{.keycombo} or [Edit \> Paste]{.menuchoice}, the result is a
    "floating selection", which is a sort of temporary layer. Before you
    can do anything else, you either have to anchor the floating
    selection to an existing layer, or convert it into a normal layer.
    If you do the latter, the new layer will be sized just large enough
    to contain the pasted material.
