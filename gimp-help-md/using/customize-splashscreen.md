Splash-screen

When you start GIMP, you see the *splash-screen* displaying short status
messages while the program is loading all its components.

You can customize the splash-screen:

-   Create a `splashes` directory inside [your personal GIMP
    configuration folder](#gimp-concepts-setup).

-   Copy your image(s) into this `splashes` directory.

On start, GIMP will read this directory and choose one of the images at
random.

::: tip
Make sure that your images aren\'t too small.
