GIMP uses the [FreeType 2](#bibliography-online-freetype) font engine to
render fonts, and a system called Fontconfig to manage them. FreeType 2
supports many common font file formats.

Any font in Fontconfig\'s font path is available in GIMP. In addition,
any font which is located in GIMP\'s Font Folders is available in GIMP.
Font Folders are set on the Fonts page in the
[Folders](#gimp-prefs-folders-data) preferences.

By default, there are two Font Folders: The system GIMP fonts folder
(which you should not alter), and a `fonts` folder inside your personal
GIMP directory. You can also add additional font folders if wanted.

-   -   Use an application like GNOME Fonts or KFontView to install the
        font.

    -   Place the font file in the directory `~/.local/share/fonts/`.
        This will make the font available to you only.

    -   If you have administrator rights, place the font file in the
        directory `/usr/local/share/fonts/`. This will make the font
        available to all users.

    In all cases, the font will become available to all programs that
    use Fontconfig.

-   -   Drag the font file into the Fonts directory `C:\Windows\Fonts`
        `C:\\Windows\\Fonts`.

    -   Install the font via the Settings app. In Windows, go to
        Settings, select Personalization, then from there go to Fonts.

-   -   Install the font via the Font Book application.

The installed fonts will show up the next time you start GIMP. If you
want to use it in an already running GIMP instance, press the *Refresh*
![](images/stock-icons/view-refresh.svg) button in the [Fonts
dialog](#gimp-font-dialog).

::: note
If for some reason you run into problems trying to install a font
system-wide, try to install the font in the `fonts` folder of your
personal GIMP directory instead (see above).

### Font Problems

Problems

In most cases, problems with fonts are caused by malformed font files or
outdated font formats. If you experience crashes at start-up when GIMP
scans your font directories, as a quick workaround you can start GIMP
with the `--no-fonts` [command line
argument](#gimp-concepts-running-command-line), but then you will not be
able to use the text tool.
