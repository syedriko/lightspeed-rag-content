# A Python plug-in writing Tutorial {#gimp-using-python-plug-in-tutorial}

Python

Tutorial

This tutorial will teach you the basics about writing a Python plug-in
for GIMP 3.0. You are expected to already have some basic knowledge
about writing Python in general. If not, there are enough Python courses
online, we are not going to duplicate that here.

GIMP plug-ins in Python (and other languages too) are called from within
GIMP to perform certain actions. To be able to know how to communicate
with, and call the plug-in, GIMP needs to know by what name to call it
and what functions it supports.

There are certain requirements regarding a plug-in\'s filename and
directory name, which have to be the same. For more details see
[Installing New Plug-Ins](#gimp-plugins-install).

## The basic elements of a plug-in for GIMP {#gimp-tutorial-python-plug-in-basics}

We will discuss the basic parts of a plug-in that are required, or at
least very common for working with GIMP.

-   Required on Linux and macOS, and common practice on Windows, is to
    start with a so-called shebang or hashbang, an encoding, and a
    copyright notice. The first line is a
    [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)), which
    specifies how this script can be executed. The next line specifies
    the encoding of the Python file. We recommend utf-8. Usually this is
    followed by several lines specifying the license under which you
    publish the script and a short description of what the script does.
    We will not go deeper into this, since this is common to Python in
    general.

-   Importing required modules to get access to GIMP and optionally GEGL
    functions.

-   Declare a class with several pre-defined functions that you need to
    adjust, so that GIMP knows what functions are available in your
    plug-in, and what functionality they support. We will go into more
    detail about this below.

-   A call that starts your plug-in, or queries its capabilities,
    depending on the arguments sent to it by GIMP.

### Required modules

To be able to access GIMP functions, we start with `import gi`. This
module can figure out what functions are available in each module
defined through "object introspection". What this means for us, is that
we import all GIMP related modules that we may need through calls to
`gi.repository`.

For basic functionality, only the Gimp and GimpUi modules may be enough.
If you want to run your plug-in from the command line, you don\'t even
need GimpUi. Let\'s start with an example.

import sys

import gi
gi.require_version('Gimp', '3.0')
from gi.repository import Gimp
gi.require_version('GimpUi', '3.0')
from gi.repository import GimpUi
from gi.repository import GLib
      
```

We start with importing sys, which we need at the end for access to
`sys.argv`, following that `import gi` tells Python that it needs to
load the gi module. This module is used to enable access to GIMP
specific functions through "object introspection".

In the next line we tell gi that we require GIMP\'s API version to be
version 3.0. (This plug-in won\'t work with older versions of GIMP.) The
following line requests to import all functions, classes, etc. from the
Gimp module.

The next two lines, do the same thing for GimpUi. GimpUi contains all
the interface related elements for GIMP. If you plan to make a plug-in
that is only going to be called from the command line, then you won\'t
need this. We finish with importing GLib, which we need later for access
to GLib.Error.

There are other optional modules that you can use too, like Gegl and
many others, but we won\'t go into that here.

### Define your plug-in class

GIMP needs to knows what functions are available, what functionality
they support, and what menu location to use. For that we define a class
that is derived from the `Gimp.PlugIn` class.

A minimal plug-in need at least the following functions defined in this
class:

-   A `do_query_procedure` method, that GIMP calls to find out the names
    of the procedures that can be called in this plug-in.

-   A `do_set_i18n` method, that GIMP calls to find out if your plug-in
    supports translations.

-   A `do_create_procedure` method, which GIMP calls to start one of
    your plug-ins functions. When this is called you should initialize
    certain information for GIMP. You start by creating a procedure that
    tells GIMP the name of the Python function to call to start your
    plug-in. Then you supply additional information, like what types of
    image does your plug-in support, where in the menu should your
    plug-in be found, and other optional settings.

-   The actual function (called procedure by GIMP) that you specified
    above. We often call this `run`, but it can have any name allowed by
    Python. This function is where you will add your own code to apply
    your desired effects.

We will go into a little more detail now. Not included below is the
first part of the Python code that was shown above. This only shows the
basic layout of your class.

``` {.python .numberLines}
class MyFirstPlugin (Gimp.PlugIn):
    def do_query_procedures(self):
        return [ "jb-plug-in-first-try" ]

    def do_set_i18n (self, name):
        return False

    def do_create_procedure(self, name):
        procedure = Gimp.ImageProcedure.new(self, name,
                                            Gimp.PDBProcType.PLUGIN,
                                            self.run, None)

        procedure.set_image_types("*")

        procedure.set_menu_label("My first Python plug-in")
        procedure.add_menu_path('<Image>/Filters/Tutorial/')

        procedure.set_documentation("My first Python plug-in tryout",
                                    "My first Python 3 plug-in for GIMP 3",
                                    name)
        procedure.set_attribution("Your name", "Your name", "2023")

        return procedure

    def run(self, procedure, run_mode, image, drawables, config, run_data):
        Gimp.message("Hello world!")
        # do what you want to do, then, in case of success, return:
        return procedure.new_return_values(Gimp.PDBStatusType.SUCCESS, GLib.Error())
      
```

Let\'s take a closer look at `do_create_procedures`. In the line
`return [ "jb-plug-in-first-try" ]` we tell GIMP what the name of our
procedure is: we call it \"jb-plug-in-first-try\". This is the name that
will be shown in GIMP\'s [Procedure Browser](#plug-in-dbbrowser).

You can have more than one procedure defined in a plug-in. In that case,
you would list all names, separated by a comma.

It is good practice to start all your procedures with your initials or
some other recognizable and unique tag. This way, it is less likely that
your name will be the same as someone elses plug-in, which may confuse
GIMP. Besides that, you are free to name it the way you like.

Next we tell GIMP that we don\'t support translations by returning False
in the call to `do_set_i18n`. What to do when you want your plug-in to
be translated is beyond the scope of this tutorial.

The `do_create_procedure` method is where most of the initializing for
GIMP is done.

-   If you define more than one procedure in your plug-in, you first
    need to check the \"name\" parameter to see which procedure is being
    called by GIMP. We won\'t go into that here.

    To initialize your plug-in procedure, we first need to create it and
    fill in the name of our Python function that will do the actual
    work. We do that by calling
    [Gimp.ImageProcedure.new](https://developer.gimp.org/api/3.0/libgimp/ctor.ImageProcedure.new.html).

    ``` python
        procedure = Gimp.ImageProcedure.new(self, name,
                                            Gimp.PDBProcType.PLUGIN,
                                            self.run, None)
              
    ```

    In this case we define the name of our plug-in as `self.run`. When
    we qualify our function with \"self.\", it means that it is a method
    inside our class. If you prefer, you can also define it as a regular
    function outside your class, in that case you would omit \"self.\".
    Naming it \"run\" is not required, you can give it any name that
    Python accepts.

-   Next we will tell GIMP what types of images this plug-in can work
    with by calling
    [procedure.set_image_types](https://developer.gimp.org/api/3.0/libgimp/method.Procedure.set_image_types.html).
    In case the type of image doesn\'t matter, we use \"\*\", which
    means all types supported by GIMP. Other examples:

    1.  \"RGB\*,GRAY\*\", where the \"\*\" here means we support both
        the versions with and without A(lpha) channel.

    2.  \"INDEXED\", plug-in only works on indexed images, without alpha
        channel.

    3.  \"RGBA\", plug-in only works on RGB image with alpha channel.

-   Being able to start your plug-in from GIMP\'s menu is usually a good
    idea. We start by defining a descriptive label for the menu entry:
    [procedure.set_menu_label](https://developer.gimp.org/api/3.0/libgimp/method.Procedure.set_menu_label.html).

-   Followed by specifying where in the menu it should appear:
    [procedure.add_menu_path](https://developer.gimp.org/api/3.0/libgimp/method.Procedure.add_menu_path.html).
    In this case we tell it to add our plug-in in the Filters menu,
    under the Tutorial category (submenu).

-   If you like you can also add an extra help tip, by using
    [procedure.set_documentation](https://developer.gimp.org/api/3.0/libgimp/method.Procedure.set_documentation.html),
    and you can set your name as author of the plug-in by using
    [procedure.set_attribution](https://developer.gimp.org/api/3.0/libgimp/method.Procedure.set_attribution.html).

-   The last line in create procedure is `return procedure`, which sends
    the information added above back to GIMP. Following this, GIMP will
    call your run procedure.

### Adding the main entry point to your plug-in

Every plug-in gets started by a call to `Gimp.main`.

``` python
        Gimp.main(MyFirstPlugin.__gtype__, sys.argv)
      
```

The only thing you need to change in this line for your plug-in, is the
name of your plug-in class, here called "MyFirstPlugin".

### The complete Python plug-in

Below we present the entire python script, which should run, provided it
is given the correct name in a directory with the same name in a
location that GIMP knows of. It will show the message "Hello world!" in
the error console or in a popup dialog.
