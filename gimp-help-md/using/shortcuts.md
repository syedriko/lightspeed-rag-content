Shortcuts

Many functions which are accessible via the main menu have a default
keyboard shortcut. You may want to create a new shortcut for a command
that you use a lot and doesn\'t have one or, more rarely, edit an
existing shortcut.

-   The [Keyboard Shortcuts Dialog](#gimp-help-keyboard-shortcuts) can
    be used to assign keyboard shortcuts. Not only for menu commands,
    but also for any other command.
