Brushes

Changing brush size

All brushes have a variable size that can be changed.

You can change the brush size in several ways:

-   Using the Size slider in the [tool
    options](#gimp-tools-paint-options). Pencil, Paintbrush, Eraser,
    Airbrush, Clone, Heal, Perspective Clone, Blur/Sharpen and
    Dodge/Burn tools have a slider to vary the brush size.

-   By using the default shortcut keys for changing a tool\'s size:

    -   Decrease size by 1: \[

    -   Increase size by 1: \]

    -   Decrease size by 10: {

    -   Increase size by 10: }

-   By using the default mouse scrollwheel actions for changing a
    tool\'s size:

    -   Decrease size by 1: [Ctrl+Alt+ +Scrollwheel Down]{.keycombo}

    -   Increase size by 1: [Ctrl+Alt+ +Scrollwheel Up]{.keycombo}

-   -   In the main window of GIMP, click on [Edit \>
        Preferences]{.menuchoice}.

    -   In the left column of the new window, select [Input Devices \>
        Input Controllers]{.menuchoice}.

    -   The Additional Input Controllers preferences are displayed with
        two columns: Available Controllers and Active Controllers.

        In the column Active Controllers, double-click the Main Mouse
        Wheel button.

    -   The Configure Input Controller dialog opens.

        In the left column Event, select the entry Scroll Up.

    -   Click the Edit event button (at the bottom middle of the list).

    -   The Select Controller Event Action dialog opens.

        In the Action column, expand the tools item.

    -   In the left column Action, select Tool\'s Size: Increase
        Relative, then click the OK button.

    -   Now the Scroll Up event is associated with the action
        tools-size-increase-percent.

    -   Close the window.

    -   With the same method, configure Scroll Down to be associated
        with Tool\'s Size: Decrease Relative.

    -   Click the OK button of the main window of Preferences.

    After these somewhat long explanations, you can use your mouse wheel
    to vary brush size. For example, choose the pencil tool with the
    Circle brush. Set the pointer in the image window, and use the mouse
    wheel in both directions to see the Circle shrinking or stretching.

-   By configuring the behavior of the Up and Down arrow keys of the
    keyboard:

    The method is similar to that of the mouse wheel. The only
    differences are:

    -   In the column Active Controllers, double-click Main Keyboard.

    -   In the column Event, edit the entry Cursor Up for the first key,
        and Cursor Down for the second key.

    -   Then, use the Up and Down arrow keys of the keyboard. The result
        is the same as with the mouse wheel.
