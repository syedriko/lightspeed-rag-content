Quick Mask

Using Quick Mask

-   Open an image or begin a new document.

-   Activate Quick Mask mode using the left-bottom button in the image
    window. If a selection is present the mask is initialized with the
    content of the selection.

-   Choose any drawing tool. Paint on the Quick Mask with black to
    remove selected areas, and paint with white to add selected areas.
    Use gray colors to partially select areas.

    You can also use selection tools and fill these selections with the
    Bucket Fill tool; this does not destroy the Quick Mask selections!

-   Toggle Quick Mask mode off using the left-bottom button in the image
    window: the selection will be displayed with [marching
    ants](#glossary-marching-ants).
