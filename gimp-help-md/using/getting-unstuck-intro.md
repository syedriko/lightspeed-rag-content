GIMP

Getting Unstuck

All right, okay: you\'re stuck. You\'re trying to use one of the tools
on an image, and nothing is happening, and nothing you try makes any

to feel warm. Are you going to have to kill the program, and lose all
your work? This sucks!

Well, hold on a second. This happens pretty frequently, even to people
who\'ve used GIMP for a long time, but generally the cause is not so
hard to figure out and fix if you know where to look. Let\'s be calm,
and go through a checklist that will probably get you GIMPing happily
again.
