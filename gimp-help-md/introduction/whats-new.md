# What\'s new in GIMP {#gimp-introduction-whats-new}

The best way to keep up-to-date with the latest changes in GIMP is to
check the [news](https://www.gimp.org/news/) on our website.

We realize that it would be nice to have localized changes of the latest
release that links to relevant pages in our documentation. However, our
team just doesn\'t have enough volunteers to make that happen. We would
welcome more people helping out with updating or translating our
documentation, so don\'t hesitate to [contact
us](https://docs.gimp.org/help.html).
